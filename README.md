# PyTorch_Model_DeepLearning_scratch
1.CNN(simple)_MNIST : first,I try to create my simple deep learning model for multi classification with MNIST dataset. the model got 98% accuracy. if you want to try my simple deep learning model, I recommend use google colab and take advantage GPU for free
2.CNN_Multi_Classification_Groceries: my second simple deep learning model that I use to mmulti classification with the groceries dataset. the model got good enough accuracy., I recommended use google colab and take advantage GPU for free if your PC does not have GPU inside
